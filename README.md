<p>This is an educational and fun game designed to help you learn about RGB color values and test your ability to identify colors based on their RGB codes.</p>

<p>The objective is simple: you'll be shown an RGB color value (e.g., RGB(255, 0, 0) for red), and you need to click on the colored square that matches it. Try to get the highest score!</p>

    *   **Hard:** Choose from 6 color squares (default).

    *   Incorrect guesses make the chosen square 'shake'.
*   **"New Color" / "Play Again?" Button:** Get a new color challenge at any time, or play again after a correct guess to keep your score.
*   **Dynamic UI:** The interface updates based on your guesses and game state, including a themed "Play Again?" button and changing header backgrounds to the winning color.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

1.  Look at the RGB value displayed at the top (e.g., `RGB(100, 50, 200)`).
2.  Examine the colored squares below.
3.  Click on the square that you believe matches the displayed RGB value.
4.  If you're correct, all squares will change to that color, your score will increase, and you can "Play Again?".
5.  If you're incorrect, the chosen square will shake, and you can "Try Again!".
6.  Use the "EASY", "HARD", or "VERY HARD" buttons to change the difficulty.
7.  Click "New Color" to get a new set of colors at any time (this doesn't reset your score unless you also change difficulty).

Enjoy the game and sharpen your RGB color skills!
